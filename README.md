**Optimizing robot trajectories**

Optibot is a python package whose objective is achieve trajectory optimization and control of dynamic systems such as robots through the use of Lagrangian physics and optimal control formulation.

Lagrangian physics are operated symbolically with SymPy, and then translated to numpy to operate numerically, and Casadi to perform optimization.
